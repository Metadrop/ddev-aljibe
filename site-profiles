## *** DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE ***
## This is an auxiliary file for site installation in Aljibe.
## It is responsible for setting the DRUPAL_PROFILE variable based on
## the name of the site being installed.
## The ddev-generated tag has been omitted so that the necessary
## logic can be added here without being overwritten by future updates.

## The $1 parameter will contain always the drush alias name (without the environment suffix)
## of the site being installed. This is the usually the name of the site folder in the sites directory too.
##
## Logic example:
##
## case $1 in
##   main)
##     DRUPAL_PROFILE=main_profile
##     ;;
##   alternative_site)
##     DRUPAL_PROFILE=
##     ;;
##
##   *)
##     DRUPAL_PROFILE=secondary_profile
##     ;;
## esac


#By default we dont se the Drupal Profile on install
